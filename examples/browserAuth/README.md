# Webrelay Auth in the Browser

This example will show you how to auth to your webrelay server from your client-side browser. After authing to the webrelay you will be able to forward OpenBazaar messages.

## Setup

This setup assumes you are running the OpenBazaar Webrelay on localhost + port 8080. If you need to update your host edit the "host" constant on auth.js

```sh
> npm install
> npm start
```

After installing the dependencies you can run the auth example by opening up index.html in your local browser. 

## Future Updates

This example project will be expanded in the future to include browser messaging, order handling, and more. The goal is to eventually develop a full browser node for OB.
